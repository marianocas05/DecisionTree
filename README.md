# Decision Tree Classifier
### Project Description
We were tasked with creating a decision tree algorithm that can read any dataset and accurately determine the outcome based on the provided data. The decision tree algorithm was developed to handle various datasets, including 'restaurant', 'weather', 'iris', and 'connect4', as well as new datasets provided by the user.

### Evaluation
The decision tree algorithm was tested on various datasets to ensure its accuracy and performance. The algorithm successfully loads, cleans, and discretizes the dataset, constructs the decision tree, and makes predictions. Any rows with missing or incorrect data are disregarded during processing.
